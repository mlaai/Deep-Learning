Write an algorithm for Dog Classification

1. Upload an image on the app
2. If a dog is detected - predict the dog's breed.
3. If a human is detected - predict the dog breed thats most resembling

Software
1. Create an app

Hardware
1. GPU ?

Deeplearning 
1. Algorithm
2. Detect a dog in an image
3. Detect a human in a image
4. CNN to classify Dog breeds
5. CNN to classify Dog breeds using Transfer Learning

Testing and Validation
1. Test Algorithm
2. Test accuracy of identifying a dog in an image
3. Test accuracy of identifying a human in an image
4. Test and validate CNN to classify dog breed
5. Test and validate CNN to classify dog breed - Transfer Learning

Detect human
1. Extract pre-trained face detector
2. Load image
3. Convert image to gray scale
4. find faces in image
5. Foreach face in image draw a box
6. Convert the image back to RGB from gray scale
7. Display the image with bounding box

To detect if an image contains human face
Function : FaceDetector
Input : Image location
Output : Number of faces
Pretrained Face Detector - CascadeClassifier , Open CV, import cv2
